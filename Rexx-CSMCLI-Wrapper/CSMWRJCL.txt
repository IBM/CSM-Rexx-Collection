-help | -h | -? (command_name)
 Displays help for the specified CLI command. If you do not specify a
 command name, this option displays help for the csmcli command. If you
 specify more parameters and arguments other than a command name, those
 parameters and arguments are ignored.

-overview
 Displays overview information about using the CLI program.

-noinfo
 Removes the copyright, version, and build information when you start
 the csmcli.

-saf
 Queries the SAF facility defined in repcli.properties to optionally
 bypass the password prompt and use the user that is currently logged
 into the OMVS shell or user specified in a BPXBATCH job calling the
 CLI. The access of a user is validated as a member of the facility if
 all prerequisite configurations were completed and expected
 permissions were set correctly.

-username user_name
 Specifies the Copy Services Manager user name with which you want to
 log in.

-password password
 Specifies the password for the Copy Services Manager user name with
 which you want to log in.
 Important: When you specify this option, the password is displayed as
 plain text. Using this form of authentication can cause a security
 exposure. If you specify a user name but not a password, and Copy
 Services Manager does not find the password in an authentication file,
 you are prompted for the password. This may fail with the wrapper
 program.

-server domain_name ip_address
 Sets the domain name or IP address of the Copy Services Manager server
 to which you want to connect.
 Remember: The server domain name or IP address is used only during
 this CLI session.

-port port
 Sets the port number to be used by the CLI program to connect to the
 Copy Services Manager server. The default value is 5110.
 Remember:
 The port number is used only during this CLI session.

-script file_name
 Runs the set of command strings in the specified file outside of an
 interactive CLI session. If you specify this parameter, you must
 specify a USS file name.
 The format options that are specified by using the setoutput command
 apply to all commands in the script.

command_string
 Runs the specified command string outside of a CLI session.
 Note: If you do not specify a command string, the wrapper program
 use the default command defined in the program. If no command is
 specified, the wrapper program cannot run the interactive console
 and may fail
